# Architecture

## What it is

A static web app / PWA (no build step) served by Vercel, talking to Supabase for shared state, plus two small Vercel functions. Everything is vanilla JavaScript.

## Front end

- **Pages**: `index.html` (the app), `guide.html`, `privacy.html`, `tv.html` (TV Mode), `admin.html` (system owner only, Phase 23).
- **Modules**: `app/*.js`, each `window.PadelstarXxx = (() => { function create({ ...deps }) { ... } })()` with dependencies injected, so most logic runs in Node tests without the browser. `app/app.js` wires everything (state, persistence, sync, rendering). Pure logic lives in `tournament-engine.js`, `scoring-engine.js`, `player-replacement.js`, `player-withdrawal.js`, `notification-center.js`, `result-correction.js`.
- **State**: one tournament object (`state`), saved locally (localStorage + IndexedDB mirror + last-known-good copy) and, for a shared tournament, written to Supabase with an expected revision. Remote states are applied by `app/core/remote-state-controller.js`, which rejects older revisions.
- **Live updates**: Supabase Realtime broadcast on `tournament:<id>` carries only the new revision; the client then fetches the state through `get_tournament_by_code` (`app/realtime-connection.js`).
- **Rendering**: `app/ui/app-renderer.js` calls the small render modules (match list, standings, player list, lobby, ...).
- **Styles**: `styles/*.css`; the classic theme rules in `ui-consistency.css` load last and win. New rules go in the topic file and use `body[data-theme="classic"]` when they must beat it.
- **Colour system** (0.11.0, replaces the generated light layer of 0.9): one token set in `styles/tokens.css`, two themes: `:root` = dark (a lifted slate navy, page `#1b2438`) and `[data-theme="light"]` = light (soft blue-white page `#eef3fa`, pure white cards). The theme is `<html data-theme="dark|light">`, set before first paint by an inline script on every page and afterwards by `app/color-mode.js` (priority: saved choice in localStorage `padelstar-theme`, then `prefers-color-scheme` read once on the first visit, then dark). The two themes are tuned independently, not inverted (e.g. accent blue `#3d97f0` on dark is `#17559f` on light); light-theme cards stay white; the light primary action is a solid deep-blue gradient with white text. **Components use `var(--token)` only**: `scripts/color-audit.js` (run by `test/color-tokens.test.js`) fails on any hex/rgb literal outside `tokens.css`. Legacy variables (`--ds-*`, `--gold*`, `--ui-*`, `--figma-*`, `--card-*`, `--ink`, `--muted`, ...) are aliases of the tokens so old rules follow the theme. Derived roles: `--accent-text` (accent as small text: bright on dark, deep on light), `--shadow-ink`, `--shadow-strength`, `--glow-strength`, `--text-glow-strength`. Player gem colours come from one helper (`PadelstarAccentSystem.gem/gemFill/gemInk/gemTint`): the base hex fills the gem in both themes, the initials are lightened 45 % on dark and darkened 30 % on light (`--gem-ink: light-dark(...)`), the row tint is `rgba(hex, .09)`. TV Mode uses the same tokens. `scripts/migrate-colors.js` is the one-time codemod that produced the migration (kept for provenance).
- **i18n**: `app/translations.js` (Norwegian Bokmål and English are the shipped languages; the others are hidden until complete). Every new text needs both. `guide.html`, `privacy.html`, `tv.html` and `admin.html` follow the saved language through `app/page-language.js` (including "device language").
- **Notifications**: `notification-system.js` (OS/push), `notification-center.js` + `-ui.js` (in-app center, vibration, settings on the profile page; no sounds of its own since 2026-10-05, the OS notifications carry the sound).

## PWA and cache-busting (important)

- `service-worker.js` precaches the app shell and serves network-first with a cache fallback; bump `cacheName` in every release.
- Every asset is loaded with `?v=padelstar-<name>-<n>`. **When a file changes, bump its number everywhere it appears** (`index.html`, `service-worker.js`, `guide.html`, `privacy.html`, `tv.html`, and the tests that pin it). `test/asset-versions.test.js` fails if a file has different versions on different pages, but it cannot know that a file changed; compare against `main` after edits.
- New modules must also be loaded in the VM harness in `test/padelstar.test.js`.

## Server side

- **Supabase**: see `database.md`.
- **Vercel functions** (`api/`): `health.js` (`/api/health`, reports the version) and `feedback.js` (emails the beta feedback through Resend; needs `RESEND_API_KEY` and `FEEDBACK_TO_EMAIL`, see `feedback-setup.md`).
- **Edge Function**: `supabase/functions/push-send` sends Web Push notifications. It authenticates the tournament's admin token, then filters the subscriptions by each player's choices (`recipients.ts`: category on/off, "only my matches", targeted withdrawal messages) before sending. Deployed with `verify_jwt: false`.
- **Headers/CSP**: `vercel.json` (same-origin framing only, needed for the guide/privacy popup).

## Tests

`node --test` (unit and page-structure tests) and the database tests in `supabase/tests/*.pglite.mjs`. `scripts/ui-audit.js` (layout, tap targets, overlaps) and `scripts/contrast-audit.js` (WCAG text contrast in the current theme) are audits to run in the browser console against the local preview.
