# Padelstar – Product Source of Truth

Padelstar is a multi-device padel tournament application/PWA for creating, running, scoring and displaying tournaments.

## Immediate delivery objective

The shortest critical product path is:

1. Owner can create an account.
2. Owner can log in.
3. Owner can create a tournament.
4. Owner can select/create Round Robin.
5. Tournament can start.
6. Results can be registered.
7. Tournament state/results persist to the server/Supabase.
8. Tournament can be completed cleanly.
9. Owner can create/start a new tournament afterwards.

This flow must be reliable before lower-priority features consume development time.

## Core principles

- Accounts are optional for ordinary tournament participation, but account ownership/history is supported.
- Shared active tournament state uses backend/database state when multiple devices participate.
- Current implemented UI is the design authority.
- Product rules must not be silently changed to match old documentation.
- Round Robin and Cup are the v1.0 tournament modes. Liga is pushed out to a later release (see `ROADMAP.md` Priority 2) per explicit developer decision.
- For the Monday usable-build milestone, Round Robin is mandatory; Cup may follow if time remains.

## Ownership/account

- Owner/account user can create and log in.
- Guest use remains possible where designed.
- Account-owned tournaments may persist in history.
- Security-sensitive owner/admin access is enforced backend/database-side.

## Round Robin

- Tournament setup can create a valid Round Robin.
- Tournament starts into a valid playable state.
- Matches/results update the tournament correctly.
- Standings/ranking update correctly.
- Tournament can reach a completed final state.
- A completed tournament must not prevent creating a new one.

## Server persistence

The backend/Supabase is authoritative for shared tournament data.

Critical tournament state must survive:

- refresh;
- reopening the app;
- ordinary device/network reconnection scenarios.

Do not treat browser local storage as the only backup/source for active shared tournament state.

## Result entry

Players/admin flows may evolve, but the immediate milestone requires that the owner/admin can reliably register match results and advance the Round Robin tournament.

Approved richer player-scoring/result-confirmation behavior remains part of the broader v1 roadmap.

## v1.0 direction

Beyond the Monday critical path, v1.0 includes the approved core functionality for:

- Round Robin;
- Cup;
- scoring/rules;
- shared live state;
- player scoring;
- result approval/correction;
- replacements;
- timed matches;
- auth/account;
- history/statistics;
- retention;
- claiming/invitations;
- notifications;
- TV Mode;
- PWA;
- i18n;
- help/privacy;
- initial system-owner foundation.

Detailed sequencing is in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Approved product behaviour (built so far)

- **Scoring**: golden point, set tiebreak and timed matches (a game won after time is up ends the match; level after time = deciding golden-point game) are rule settings; ties in the table are broken head-to-head. One active scorer per match; a player-scored result is approved by one player of each team (auto-approved after 30 minutes, or at once when only one team uses the app); the admin can always approve and can correct a finished result with a reason (the old result is kept and can be restored). Nothing can be corrected after the tournament is finished.
- **Players who leave**: the admin can replace a player (a running match restarts at 0–0 after a warning) or withdraw them without a replacement: their unplayed matches wait for the remaining teammate, who plays alone (1 against 2) or gives a walkover (the admin can decide for them).
- **Guests and accounts**: guests use a temporary session per device; a name alone never takes over a claimed slot. A signed-in account can claim an unclaimed pre-added slot; statistics follow the account. The admin can invite people by email; an invitation reserves nothing until the person joins and lapses when the first round starts.
- **History**: only account players get permanent statistics, written once at the finish; deleting a tournament never deletes anyone's statistics.
- **Retention**: a finished guest tournament stays readable for 24 hours; an idle one expires after 30 days and is deleted 7 days later unless resumed; account tournaments and statistics are kept.
- **Notifications**: in-app notifications (match ready, result to approve, teammate withdrew, correction, finished) with a notification center; sounds and vibration can be switched off on the profile page.
- **TV Mode** opens in a new tab, read-only, in the chosen language. **Guide and privacy** open as a popup.
- **System owner**: exactly one protected owner, stored in the database; `admin.html` and its data are for the owner only (details below).
- **Corrections after the finish**: the admin can still correct a finished result (not in a cancelled tournament); the account statistics follow the corrected result. A Cup result that later matches depend on stays blocked.
- **Invitations by email**: the invitation is saved in the app first, then emailed from `invitations@padelstar.app` (join link and code). The invited person also sees it under Profil after signing in with that verified address.
- **System owner**: `admin.html` has Oversikt, Turneringer (search, filter, paging), Brukere (search, block, unblock, delete; never the owner), Logg (sign-ups, tournaments created/finished/deleted, the owner's own actions; ids only, 90 days) and Vedlikehold (cleanup jobs). Everything else the owner could do with other people's tournaments is deliberately not built (privacy).
- **TV Mode** works on desktop and phone (button in the rail and the phone tab bar; the page stacks on a phone) and has the Lys/Mørk switch.
- **Privacy text** ends with a section naming the services used (Supabase in the EU, Vercel, Resend, jsDelivr, flagcdn.com, Cloudflare Turnstile, quickchart.io).
- **Colour system**: one token set (`styles/tokens.css`), two themes: dark is a lifted slate navy, light is a soft blue-white with white cards; the choice is saved, the device decides only on the first visit. No colour literals in components.
- **One screen for lobby, Styring, Kamper and Tabell** (0.12.0): the lobby is the first panel of the workspace, reached from the side rail, the phone tab bar and the sub-tabs.
- **Withdrawal in a Cup** (0.13.0): the same conditions as in a Round Robin; a fully withdrawn team = walkover; both sides of a match withdrawn = the best-placed losing team takes the place after the admin confirms.
- **Sign-up check**: a Cloudflare Turnstile "I'm not a robot" dialog before sign-up, sign-in and the admin sign-in link (enforced by Supabase).
- **Two-factor for System** (0.14.0): the owner needs a code from an authenticator app (TOTP) on top of signing in; every owner function checks it in the database.
- **Push categories** (0.15.0): each device chooses match/round, results, withdrawal decisions and "only my own matches"; the server filters before sending. Invitation push is planned.
- **Unverified accounts** are deleted after 7 days (0.13.1).

## Decided, not yet built

Nothing is decided and unbuilt at the moment; see `docs/ROADMAP.md` for what remains before 1.0.0.


## Later versions

1.x may add templates, additional tournament modes and expanded system administration.

2.0.0 is the social expansion, including friend-list/social functionality.

Permanent tamper-protected security audit logging is post-1.0.

## Version baseline

The actual current development baseline is `0.17.1` (field-test fix 2026-10-03: a player who joins by QR keeps their player view after a reload; `0.17.0` was the generic scoring engine with a Tennis and a Points mode, 2026-09-24; `0.16.2` removed the older result-proposal flow, 2026-09-22; `0.16.1` was the popup fix; `0.16.0` was the expired-tournament notice; `0.15.1` was colour spec additions; `0.15.0` was push categories; `0.14.0` was two-factor for the system menu; `0.13.1` deleted unverified accounts after 7 days; `0.13.0` was withdrawal in a Cup; `0.12.0` was the lobby merged into the workspace; `0.11.1` was fixes after the colour system; `0.11.0` was the colour system; `0.10.0` was the decisions batch; `0.9.1` was the first bug-fix batch the same day; `0.9.0` was applied 2026-09-19 under the developer's standing authorization to bump fully verified milestones; `docs/CHANGELOG.md` lists what was verified and what still awaits a person on real devices). `0.7.0` was the beta feature milestone.

`0.7.0` was applied on the developer's explicit instruction (2026-09-19) for the beta feature milestone (scorer roles, result approval and correction, timed matches and scoring rules, player replacement, TV Mode in every supported language, feedback button); `docs/CHANGELOG.md` lists which parts have been verified live and which still await it. `0.6.0` was set once the Monday critical path was verified end-to-end; `0.6.1` is a verified UI-redesign/polish batch on top of it (fonts, design tokens, gem avatars, workspace nav shell, a handful of real bug fixes) that changed no critical-path behavior.

Version changes are milestone-based:

- patch (`0.5.x`) for verified bug-fix batches;
- minor (`0.x.0`) for coherent verified feature milestones;
- `1.0.0` only after the complete v1.0 Definition of Done.

Codex may recommend a version after a completed verified milestone, but only the developer decides whether to apply the version change.
